fleeting-plugin-openstack
=========================

GitLab fleeting plugin for OpenStack.

https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker_autoscaler.html


Plugin Configuration
--------------------

The following parameters are supported:

| Parameter             | Type   | Description |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------|
| `cloud`               | string | Name of the cloud config from clouds.yaml to use |
| `clouds_config`       | string | Optional. Path to clouds.yaml |
| `auth_from_env`       | bool   | Optional. Use environment variables for authentication |
| `name`                | string | Name of the Auto Scaling Group (unique string that used to find instances) |
| `nova_microversion`   | string | Optional. Microversion for the Openstack Nova client. Default 2.79 (which should be ok for Train+) |
| `boot_time`           | string | Optional. Maximum wait time for instance to boot up. During that time plugin check Cloud-Init signatures. |
| `use_ignition`        | string | Enable Fedora CoreOS / Flatcar Linux Ignition support |
| `server_spec`         | object | Server spec used to create instances. See: [Compute API](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/#create-server) |


### Default connector config

| Parameter                | Default  |
|--------------------------|----------|
| `os`                     | `linux`  |
| `protocol`               | `ssh`    |
| `username`               | `unset`  |
| `use_static_credentials` | `false`  |


OpenStack setup
---------------

1. You should create a special user (recommended) and project (optional),
   then export clouds.yaml with credentials for that cloud.

  1. Optional: You can also use OS\_\* environment variables to authenticate.

2. You may create a tenant network for workers, in that case don't forget to add a router.
   In that case manager VM should have two ports: external and that tenant network,
   so it will be able to connect to the worker instances.

3. You should upload a special image with container runtime installed in it.
   For example we use [Flatcar Linux](https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/current/)

4. *(Optional)* You should generate SSH keypair which will be used by manager instance to connect to workers.
   Public key must be added to Nova from the user.

   Note: that key required only for Cloud-Init based images. For a Flatcar plugin can generate dynamic ssh key and pass it via Ignition script.

Preparation of the resources could be done by Heat using [heat/stack.yaml](heat/stack.yaml).
But consider it as an example.
